## folder_toc_generator
1. Generates folder tree structure for the given directory.
2. If the `.xlsm` file is placed within the directory, clicking on a file or sub-folder in the tree structure will open that file or sub-folder, as the items in the tree structure are hyperlinked to the files or folders they represent.
